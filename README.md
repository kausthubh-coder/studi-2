# Project Title

This project is a full-stack application built with Next.js, Convex, and Tailwind CSS. It provides a platform for real-time collaboration and chat functionalities.

## Features

*   Real-time chat: Users can send and receive messages instantly.
*   Collaborative canvas: Users can draw and edit on a shared canvas.
*   User authentication: Secure sign-up and sign-in functionality.
*   Responsive design: The application is optimized for various screen sizes.

## Tech Stack

*   **Frontend:** Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS
*   **Backend:** Convex (Real-time database and serverless functions)
*   **Authentication:** Clerk

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

*   Node.js (v18 or later)
*   npm or yarn

## Getting Started

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-project-name.git
    cd your-project-name
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```

3.  **Set up Convex:**

    *   Sign up for a Convex account at [https://www.convex.dev/](https://www.convex.dev/).
    *   Create a new project in the Convex dashboard.
    *   Install the Convex CLI:
        ```bash
        npm install -g convex
        ```
    *   Log in to your Convex account:
        ```bash
        npx convex login
        ```
    *   Initialize Convex in your project:
        ```bash
        npx convex init
        ```
        Follow the prompts and select your Convex project. This will create a `convex/` directory and `.env.local` file with your Convex deployment URL.

4.  **Set up Clerk (Authentication):**

    *   Sign up for a Clerk account at [https://clerk.com/](https://clerk.com/).
    *   Create a new application in the Clerk dashboard.
    *   Navigate to "API Keys" in your Clerk application settings.
    *   Copy the "Frontend API key" and "Backend API key".
    *   Add these keys to your `.env.local` file:

        ```env
        NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_frontend_api_key
        CLERK_SECRET_KEY=your_backend_api_key
        ```
    *  In the Clerk Dashboard, go to JWT Templates and create a new template. Select Convex. Copy the JWKS endpoint.
    *  Go to your Convex Dashboard. In Settings -> Auth, add a new Auth Provider. Select `HTTPS / JWT` and `Clerk` as the provider. Fill in `JWKS endpoint` with the value from the Clerk template. Set `issuer` to your Clerk application's domain (e.g., `https://cool-gazelle-123.clerk.accounts.dev` - found in Clerk Dashboard -> API Keys -> Clerk URLs).

5.  **Push Convex schema and functions:**

    ```bash
    npx convex dev
    ```
    This command will watch for changes in your `convex/` directory and automatically sync them with your Convex deployment. Keep this running in a separate terminal.

6.  **Run the development server:**

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    ```

    Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the application.
