Fix Clerk authentication routes and middleware configuration

- Implemented proper catch-all routes for Clerk authentication:
  - Created [[...sign-in]] route for sign-in page
  - Created [[...sign-up]] route for sign-up page
  - Removed conflicting regular route files
- Updated environment variables for Clerk authentication paths
- Ensured middleware properly handles public authentication routes
- Fixed route conflicts to resolve Clerk component configuration error

These changes establish the correct route structure required by Clerk's
authentication components and ensure proper handling of sign-in/sign-up flows.
The authentication routes are now properly configured as public routes in the
middleware while maintaining protection for other routes.
