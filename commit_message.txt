Refactor chat message type handling and streamline onboarding flow, first build

- Removed redundant Clerk onboarding tracking in favor of using only Convex
- Deleted unnecessary server action in src/app/actions.ts
- Refactored message type handling across chat components:
  - Created local MessageType interface in ChatContainer.tsx
  - Updated Message.tsx and MessageList.tsx to import type from ChatContainer
  - Eliminated dependency on external types file
- Simplified onboarding flow to use only Convex database for state tracking
- Improved error handling in auth redirect hook
- Enhanced performance by reducing network requests during onboarding

These changes consolidate type definitions to follow component-level organization,
remove redundant code paths for onboarding, and improve type safety throughout
the codebase. The changes make the app more maintainable by establishing a single
source of truth for user onboarding status in Convex.
